## Project Name
Racing-game Wrummm (aka HotWheels simulator)

# Features
Welcome to my web browser game - a thrilling two-player racing simulator! In this game, players can upgrade their cars' engines, transmissions, brakes, and tires to secure victory on various tracks with unpredictable weather and road conditions. The racing aspect is a realistic simulator, where players cannot directly influence the outcome of the races. However, strategic upgrades can significantly impact their chances of success.
As you compete in races, every win rewards you with $100, while every loss results in a loss of $100. The race to financial victory begins as each player strives to be the first to accumulate $0 in their bank account.
With engaging gameplay and the element of chance through dynamic tracks and weather, this game promises a competitive experience for players. Get ready to optimize your car's performance, make strategic decisions, and outmaneuver your opponent on your way to financial supremacy!

# Game Mechanics:
Each round, you have the opportunity to spend $100 on upgrading four key components of your car: Engine, Transmission, Tires, and Brakes. However, it is important to consider your budget carefully, as you will need money on hand in case you lose the round.

To initiate a race, you must place a bet of $100 for your potential win and press the "READY" button.

After the race concludes, the winner will receive their initial $100 bet back, along with an additional $100 from the loser's bet. This serves as the prize for winning the race.

The game progresses to the next round, where you will once again have the opportunity to upgrade your car and place another bet.

The game will continue until one player's account balance reaches zero. At that point, the game concludes, and the player with no money remaining is declared the loser.

Please note: It is essential to manage your finances wisely and make strategic decisions in each round to maximize your chances of winning while maintaining a sufficient bank balance.
